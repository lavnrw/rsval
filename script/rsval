#!/usr/bin/env sh

# This is an example wrapper script for the rsval tool running on Linux (and
# probably other Unix-like operating systems). Adapt it to your environment and
# needs, make sure it is executable (chmod 755), and put it somewhere in your
# PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/rsval`).

# Uncomment this line if you experience encoding issues with Umlaut characters
# in file names when the Rendition Server is running on a Windows host.
# export LANG=de_DE.ISO-8859-1

# This line runs the rsval JAR file, threading through any command line
# parameters that were given to this wrapper script (in the $@ variable). If
# you didn't save your JAR file at the specified location `/opt/rs/rsval.jar`
# you have to adapt the path.
java -jar /opt/rs/rsval.jar "$@"

# Use the following command instead if you like fancy colored terminal output.
# java -jar /opt/rs/rsval.jar "$@" | grep -E --color '^(VALID|INVALID|ERROR)|$'
